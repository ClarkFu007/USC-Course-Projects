CERTIFY IT'S YOUR WORK

"I certify that the work submitted for this assignment does not
violate USC's student conduct code.  In particular, the work is my
own, not a collaboration, and does not involve code created by other
people, except for the the resources explicitly mentioned in the CS 455

ACKNOWLEDGE ANY OUTSIDE SOURCES

List here any code you submitted for this assignment that was written
with significant help of a course staff member, or code used from the
textbook.  Be specific about what methods or algorithms are involved,
and what sections of the textbook are involved (if applicable): [you do
not need to list any of the code that we wrote for the assignment,
i.e., the contents of the starter files for the assignment]
1. CarViewer.java, CarComponent.java, and Car.java, whose are the example 
in Section 3.8 of the textbook.

2. CoinTossSimulator.java: my CoinTossSimulator class. The involved methods
are "run", "getNumTrials", "getTwoHeads", "getTwoTails", "getHeadTails", 
and "reset".

3. Bar.java A Bar class. The involved method is "draw".

4. The section 6.9 of the textbook for an example to hava a java random number 
generator.

5. The section 2.10.4 of the textbook for an example to draw a filled rectangle 
as an alien face.

ANSWERS TO ASSIGNMENT README QUESTIONS (if applicable):
1. The outside code resources students will be allowed to use in assignments for this 
class are limited to code written by the course staff for the purposes of helping students 
in the course, or code from the textbook for this course. If you do use any such code not 
written by you, you are required to acknowledge your sources in your README file.

2. The probability of the incident "two heads" is 0.25, the probability of the incident 
"one head and one tail" is 0.5, and the probability of the incident "two tails" is 0.25.

Because there are four situations in every trial: 1st head, 2nd head; 1st tail, 2nd head;
1st head, 2nd tail; and 1st tail, 2nd tail, where two of four situations belong to the case
"one head and one tail" and other two situations belong to other tow cases individually. 
  
3.      Two Heads | One Head and One Tail | Two Tails
   200    0.230             0.520              0.250
   400    0.235             0.530              0.235
   600    0.255             0.512              0.233
   800    0.249             0.518              0.234
   805    0.252             0.501              0.247
   810    0.254             0.499              0.247
   815    0.254             0.498              0.248
   820    0.254             0.498              0.246
  1000    0.250             0.508              0.242
  1200    0.252             0.505              0.243
  1400    0.257             0.499              0.244
  1600    0.254             0.504              0.242
    Therefore, roughly 805 trials I need to do before I mostly get results within 1% of 
these probabilities.

4. When the number of trials is 2147483647, it will work correctly. However, when the 
number of trials is 2147483648, it will crash.
